# Todo-List

 
Introduction: 
This is a simple To-Do list app built using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
The app allows any user to create a task with selecting particular Date and time, edit and delete tasks, and also provides a feature to mark tasks as completed.

      for the better experience on the mobile of this web application.

Features:
1.Create new tasks with a description, date, and time
2.Edit existing tasks
3.Delete tasks
4.Mark tasks as completed
6.Store tasks locally using local Storage
7.Load tasks from local Storage when the app is loaded
8.Clear all tasks and local Storage with a single button click

4.Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed
5.Click the "Edit" button to edit a task
